# GambleGone

Over 2.8 million Indonesians are drawn to online gambling, thus the government has made great efforts to combat this expanding problem, which has had a big influence on society. Nevertheless, a lot of people are still affected by gambling addiction, despite extensive regulatory measures. GambleGone seeks to close this gap by offering all-encompassing assistance and direction via sophisticated AI-generated tools and tailored resources. With a lifeline to recovery and a better, addiction-free future, GambleGone is committed to making a significant difference in the lives of people impacted by gambling addiction.

GambleGone strongly aligns with the 3rd and 11th Sustainable Development Goals, Good Health and Well-being and Sustainable Cities and Communities. By tackling the issue of gambling addiction, GambleGone contributes to the promotion of mental health and well-being, a key target of the 3rd SDG. Our platform provides crucial support and guidance for individuals struggling with gambling addiction, fostering healthier lifestyles and mental resilience. Furthermore, GambleGone's efforts support the 11th SDG by helping to build more sustainable communities. By reducing the prevalence of gambling addiction, we contribute to creating safer, more inclusive communities where individuals can thrive without the detrimental impacts of addiction. Through our comprehensive approach, GambleGone aims to not only address the immediate challenges of gambling addiction but also to promote long-term health and sustainability in communities across Indonesia.
